# Esx_ZombieSystem
Modified Esx_ZombieSystem from Dislaik


I tried to make a good v1 esx zombie script with this two (esx_zombiesystem and ZO Zombie Outbreak framework both scripts are from Dislaik) and has you can see i'm not like him and neither am I close to him because this code doesn't work. **Reason Why I did this**: I wanted a esx v1 zombies script with synced zombies and grunt sounds. I thought merging this 2 scripts would be a great idea because they complete each other very well, but it didn’t went well…

**Problems:** 
1- By Default Zombies don't spawn, they only kinda spawn if you disable Config.NoPeds;
2- They don't come for you, they just wander around like normal npcs but covered in blood and drunk;

**If somebody can fix this I would be much appreciated.**
